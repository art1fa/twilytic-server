Twilytic (Server)
============

Communicates with client and database.

## Usage

Install [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Start the RethinkDB server:

```bash
rethinkdb
```

Clone the repository, install dependencies and run the server. On the first run, if not existing, the database `twitterdb` will be created with the tables `tweets` and `users`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/art1fa/twilytic-server.git
cd twilytic-server
npm install
npm start
```
## Note 

To make Twilytic work, you also need to install, configure and run [twilytic-client](https://github.com/art1fa/twilytic-client) and [twilytic-scripts](https://github.com/art1fa/twilytic-scripts).


## About
